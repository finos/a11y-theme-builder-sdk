# Accessibility Theme Builder SDK

Accessibility compliance is both a difficult and a cost intensive task.  This is true not only when creating an initially compliant application, but also when maintaining that compliance.

The purpose of this SDK is to simplify this task by performing the necessary calculations and generating output (e.g. CSS, JSON tokens, or other) to be imported into your application.  

This SDK is designed to be extensible with regard to each of the following:

* output generators (e.g. CSS, JSON tokens, etc),
* atoms,
* molecules,
* organisms, and
* accessibility layers (e.g. color blindness, motion sensitivity, etc).

## Getting Started

### Using the Web App

For both a broad overview of accessibility compliance and a user-friendly web application which you may use in order to build your themes, see the  [Accessibility Theme Builder repository](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/blob/main/README.md#accessibility-theme-builder).  The web application in that repository uses this SDK to perform it's calculations and to generate output.

### Using the SDK directly

If you want to learn more about how to use this SDK directly, see the [SDK Tutorial](./TUTORIAL.md).

For more in-depth information about the APIs, see the [API documentation](https://discoverfinancial.github.io/a11y-theme-builder-sdk/modules.html).
